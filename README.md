# Desktop_Backup
This module will backup all files on the desktop with the option to exclude what you do not want copied

Set up the folders and files you do not want copied in the "Exclusions" section near the bottom of the code. 
Example: I don't want file 1, file 2, and file 3 to be copied
exclusions = ["file 1", "file 2", "file 3"]
