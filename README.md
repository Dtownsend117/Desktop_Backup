# Desktop_Backup
This is a module I whipped up while working on the alternate Data_Backup modules

You can set the folder that everything will copy to, while also setting specific files/folders that will not be copied

Set up the folders and files you do not want copied in the "Exclusions" section near the bottom of the code. 
Example: I don't want file 1, file 2, and file 3 to be copied
exclusions = ["file 1", "file 2", "file 3"]
